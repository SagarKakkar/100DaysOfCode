# [Find second largest element](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1/#)

Given an array of elements. Your task is to find the second maximum element in the array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N=5
arr[] = { 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 }
Output:  6
Explanation:
The largest element is 7 and 
the second largest element is 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N=6
arr[] = { 7, 8, 2, 1, 4, 3 }
Output:  7
```

**Your Task:**
Since, this is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function print2largest() that takes array A and integer N as parameters and returns the second maximum element in the array. If there does not exist any second largest element, then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

 

**Constraints:**
* `1 ≤ N ≤ 106`
